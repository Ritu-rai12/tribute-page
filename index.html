            Before marriage, her name was Manukarnika and also manu.
            Rani Lakshmi Bai was born on 19 November 1828(some sources say 1835) in the town of Benares (now Varanasi)
            into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre
            (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri
            district of Maharashtra. Her mother died when she was four years old. Her father was the Commander of the
            war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district. The Peshwa called her
            "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to
            read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included
            shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba with her childhood friend Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope was the
            Guru of these.Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's
            society at this time. And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social
            norms even in front of the whole society.
            <p><span style="color:red;">Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in
                    May 1842 and was afterwards called Lakshmibai</span> in honour of the Hindu goddess Devi Lakshmi and
                according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September
                1851, she gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth due to a
                chronic illness. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who
                was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the
                British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated
                with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime.

                After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted
                son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of
                Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she
                was informed of this she cried out "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi". In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was
                given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.

                According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse, the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling and steeplechasing
                before breakfast. An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a businesslike manner.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(224, 63, 14);">On 10 May 1857, the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When news of the
                rebellion reached Jhansi, the Rani asked the British political officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for
                permission to raise a body of armed men for her own protection; Skene agreed to this.The city was
                relatively calm in the midst of the regional unrest in the summer of 1857, but the Rani conducted a
                Haldi Kumkum ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide assurance to her
                subjects, and to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of them.</p>
            <p>When I was read about Rani Lakshmi Bai I was so affected by her life.I wanted to make like her.I respect
                her so much.She was strong and intelligent.She was so supportive of helpless people, poor people etc.
                She was so kind.I like everything of her but I didn't like one thing that was if someone was cheated her
                greater than twice and if he said sorry and was act to cry the she forgived him again and again that's
                why she always faced many more problems.I miss her so much.
                She wanted to independent of Jhansi and also whole India from britishes.She wanted that Indians live
                independently.Britishes was so cruel. <span style="color:rgb(45, 210, 15);">Rani Lakshmi Bai was the
                    first revolutionary who was started revolution against britishes.</span>Many more revolutionaries
                supoorted to her like Tatya Tope, Samar Singh etc. If all the kings of that time would support Rani
                Lakshmi Bai then perhaps India would have become independent at that time itself.Rani Lakshmi Bai ki
                Jai. </p>
